# Take Home Engineering Challenge

We are a very practical team at Microsoft and this extends to the way that we work with you to find out if this team is a great fit for you. We want you to gain a great understanding of the work that we actually do day to day and what it is like to work with us.

So instead of coding at a whiteboard with someone watching over your shoulder under high pressure, which is not a thing we often do, we instead discuss code that you have written previously when we meet.

## Guidelines

-   This is meant to be an assignment for which you spend approximately three hours of dedicated, focused work. Do not feel like you need to overengineer the solution with dozens of hours to impress us. Be biased toward production-ready quality over features.

-   Think of this like an open source project. Create a repo on Github, use git for source control, and use README.md to document what you built for the newcomer to your project.  Feel free to create a private repo and share it with us if you prefer to keep your submission out of public view.

-   Our team builds, alongside our customers and partners, systems engineered to run in production. Given this, please organize, design, test, deploy, and document your solution as if you were going to put into production. We completely understand this might mean you can't do as much in the time budget. 

-   Think out loud in your submission's documentation. Document tradeoffs, the rationale behind your technical choices, or things you would do (or do differently) if you were able to spend more time on the project or do it again.

-   Please use some aspects of Power Platform in your solution, but feel free to use any other technologies to extend or augment your low-code solution as needed. Make sure to document how to get started with your solution in terms of setup.

## The Problem 

Helping frontline workers complete their day to day tasks is a common business scenario.  The City of Santa Monica publishes their [Building Permit Inspection Schedule as open data](https://data.smgov.net/Permits-Licenses/Permit-Inspections-Schedule/xird-2kxi).  Building inspectors need to travel to various locations throughout the day to inspect building that are under construction.  Building inspector supervisors need to ensure timely delivery of services and analyze overall trends.  Please build something that helps the Building and Safety Division manage their requests for building permit inspections.  

## The Assignment

This is a freeform assignment.  Feel free to tackle this problem in a way that demonstrates your expertise of an area -- or takes you out of your comfort zone.  For example, you could build ...
* a UI that helps building inspectors complete their assigned inspections
* an integration with a collaboration app like teams or outlook
* a virtual agent that helps coordinate the work
* something else you think would be valuable for the building inspectors

You can connect your solution directly to the API or import your data to a database (to simulate this as an internal application).

Good luck! Please send a link to your solution on Github back to us at least 12 hours before your interview so we can review it before we speak.
